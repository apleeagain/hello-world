Hey Dan,
thanks you for your insightful advice on Exercism. Nothing is unsolicited
in my case.

(I'm writing to you in this format because I currently only have access to
a phone, and the resizing stuff doesn't work on exercism so I CAN'T SEND
MY MESSAGE rghh.)

- It is my personal opinion, but I find satisfaction in these kinds of optimizations.
But is it at all an optimization when constantly converting from i8 to isize on each usage?

- I have implemented your second suggestion, via as_bytes().
- I am satisfied to say this happened: `row.as_bytes().iter()...`
can be replaced by `row.bytes()...` to the same effect, resulting in
an iterator producing owned bytes, eliminating the need for your third
suggestion at all (though otherwise, I would have implemented it).

- it turns out my recent iterations were filled with unsafe code were filled
with logic and therefore soundness bugs, yikes... now should be fixed

Thanks, again!
