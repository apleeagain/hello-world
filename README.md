The entire purpose of this repository is to help me lrn2github.

## About me.
I intend to use GitHub as a code repository for a MUD that I am writing. I have never used any kind of code management or version control before (aside from manually archiving directories and storing them in a backup location), but I blew away a working directory for the first time this morning, so I figured it was time to start.
